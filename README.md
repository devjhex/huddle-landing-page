## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS


### What I learned

In this project I learned how to style with Tailwind CSS for the whole project. My first experience was very exciting and enjoyable because tailwind CSS makes styling easy and to make matters even better, its still hard coded CSS and you really have to understand the fundamentals of CSS to get comfortable with Tailwind CSS


### Continued development
I am really determined to get better and very comfortable with tailwind css so because to be honest tailwind just makes writing and consistency easier than but it still won't be a substitute for the fundamentals hence I will be building with Tailwind CSS than the other frameworks for that matter.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - This helped me to get the core concepts of how tailwindCSS works and some of the units that are come in handy.
